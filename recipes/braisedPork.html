  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>
    Buta no kakuni is a classic Japanese dish of braised pork belly that is slowly cooked until the meat is tender, juicy,
    and packed full of umami. It is simmered with traditional
    Japanese flavors that include soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar, with a hint of ginger and scallions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pork belly is the cut where bacon originates and is quite heavy in fat, but the extended time that this Japanese-style braised 
    pork belly is simmered with ginger and scallions reduces the fat in 
    the finished dish. The pork is then simmered again in a fresh pot of water and sauce ingredients to season it.

  <p>
    Give Japanese buta no kakuni a try and you might be pleasantly surprised at how a small, tender piece of braised pork 
    belly brightens up the dinner table as an appetizer
    or side dish. A small piece is also a wonderful addition the next day in a Japanese bento lunch.
